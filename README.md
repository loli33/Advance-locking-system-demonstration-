PROJECT DESCRIPTION
  We may came to hear about the news od bikes theft in pubilc nowadays i happen often so we have build a product type model to over come this problem.Think of bikes which are costlier.
To provide a PIN verification before turn ON the ignition.
Steps involved:
 1)Turn ON the key
 2)Enter PIN
 3)Ignition ON automatically no need to use self start or kicker in bikes.No self start is provided because if you enter correct PIN the bike will turn ON else it will remain OFF.
 4)The stand will automatically retract to ensure safety of the rider.
 5)if you turn OFF the key the ignition will turn OFF and side stand returns to its original place.
 
 
*Here no ignition ON/OFF system is installed just a demonstaration of the process*
  


Please note the GPIO pins before you run the code and I have attached the test code for each components.
